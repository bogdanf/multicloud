    "- What is a Vector?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A vector is like a fingerprint for information. Just like every person’s fingerprint is unique and gives us lots of details about them, a vector in AI is a unique set of numbers representing the important semantic features of a piece of information, like a block of text, an image, a sound, or a video.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is Similarity Search and Outlier Search?\n",
    "\n",
    "    A similarity search helps you find semantically similar things, like Google or Bing does. But imagine being able to do that in the database, with text, audio, image, and video files and the full power of SQL and PL/SQL at your disposal. An outlier search does the opposite: it retrieves the most dissimilar results.\n",
    "\n",
    "- What is a LLM?\n",
    "\n",
    "    LLMs, or Large Language Models, are AI algorithms that use deep learning techniques and large data sets to understand, summarize, generate, and predict new content. Oracle AI Vector Search works well with any Large Language Model [LLM] and vector embedding model.\n",

    "- What is RAG?\n",
    "\n",
    "    Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that enhances LLMs by integrating Similarity Search. This enables use cases such as a corporate chatbot responding with private company knowledge to make sure it’s giving answers that are up-to-date and tailored to your business."

The Retrieval-Augmented Generation architecture combines retrieval-based and generation-based methods to enhance natural language processing tasks.

This dual approach improves accuracy and detail compared to models relying solely on pre-trained knowledge.\n",

This ensures that the top-N relevant documents are selected to provide additional context for the generator. By doing so, the retriever enhances the quality of the generated text, particularly for queries needing specific or up-to-date information.\n",
